# GPTunes

GPTunes is a (yet) unfinished project (but functional), powered by Flask and GPT-3. Indulge
your senses and broaden your horizons by searching for your favourite songs and
discover lyrics, unravel meanings, explore song histories and be delighted by
fascinating, fun facts.


## Usage
How can you get this working on your computer? You know the deal, put the
Open AI API key in your environment:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

To get the lyrics you should get a token for the [Genius API](https://docs.genius.com/#/authentication-h1)
and do the same thing:

```bash
export GENIUS_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

## Example

This is what GPTunes has to say about The World Is Yours by Nas:
